      <description>This is a project I had seen on blog posts about projects similar to this, so I knew this would be something I created. This project is broken up into 2 parts. The first part i built was a python web crawler that uses beautiful soup to crawl the jobs on indeed that are entry level Software Engineering jobs in Louisville, Kentucky. The program grabs the job, job title, job summary, and the link to the posting and saves them into a csv file.</description>

      <description>This started as a way to prove to myself that I could make a website without the use of any libraries or frameworks. I planned on going to the pool with my friends, for memorial day, but wanted to accomplish something technical so that the day would not be wasted. In my work with D3 I learned to manipulate the DOM when a slider changed. With this knowledge I create a system that changes the background RGBA to match the values of the Red, Green, Blue, and Alpha sliders.</description>

      <description>I consider Sprinkle of Jeezy to be my baby. I came up with the idea when I first started programming, after seeing a similar app gain popularity on twitter, but at the time I had no knowledge of how to make it. After completing Colt Steele&#39;s Web Develeper Bootcamp course on Udemy, I knew enough to be dangerous. The application&#39;s home page uses an AJAX call to display randomly selected quotes stored in the backend database.</description>
